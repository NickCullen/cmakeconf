# cmakeconf
A python library which will take a .cm file and generate a CmakeLists.txt file for specified modules.
This is adding another abstracted layer on top of cmake to simplfy projects as well as not needing to learn the cmake syntax.

#### Examples
###### Example1 
Example 1 consists of a simple project with one include directory and one source directory with no libs.
Output is a single executable file.
